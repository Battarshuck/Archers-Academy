# Archers-Academy
Archers Academy website

--------------------------------------------

This website is a personel project that I'm working on alone for my training (yeah I do archery).
And I hope after I finish the webiste they accept it.

react v16.13.1,
bootstrap v4.0.0-alpha.6,
jquery v3.3.1,
tether v1.3.3

-The skateboard pictures are just a prototype. 

 
-The annoucements section is fully dynamic, that means while it seems that one annoucement takes place (test 4 in this example),  the array contains 5 annoucements but the website is going to only show the newest one.
